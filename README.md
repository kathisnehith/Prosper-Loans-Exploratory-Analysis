# Prosper-Loans-Exploratory-Analysis

## Introduction:

This project immerses itself in a comprehensive dataset stemming from Prosper, a prominent peer-to-peer lending platform in the United States. Prosper's mission revolves around simplifying the process of obtaining personal loans, and this dataset offers a rich tapestry of information spanning 113,937 loan listings from Q4-2005 to Q1-2014. The data encompass 81 variables that can be classified into three distinct categories: borrower information, loan performance information, and loan listing details. Our exploration will commence with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), delving into univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover patterns, relationships, and potential anomalies within the dataset. During this phase, we will seamlessly integrate data assessment and cleaning procedures, ensuring data integrity and addressing any irregularities or missing values in a concise and efficient manner. Our objective is to derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making processes within the peer-to-peer lending ecosystem, enabling stakeholders to optimize loan underwriting, risk management, and overall portfolio performance.
